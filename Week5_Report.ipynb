    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I will explore Toronto city's data. Imagining someone wants to open a new restaurant there, I will try to find the best fitting location in town focussing on central areas that are not already covered with many restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of 2,731,571 in 2016. Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA. Toronto is the fastest growing city in North America and is the anchor of an urban agglomeration, known as the Golden Horseshoe in Southern Ontario, located on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having such vast population and big geographical area, there also exists big competition between businesses. Therefore it became very challenging for new businesses to decide which area they should start their business to get higher revenue with lowest possible competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Target Audience for this project is a new business who wants to open a restaurant in Toronto. The main idea of this project is to suggest the best locality for the new restaurant in order to maximize profits in Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data description\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decission are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Already existing restaurants in the neighborhood (any type of restaurant)\n",
    "- Location of neighborhoods in the city center\n",
    "\n",
    "Following data sources will be needed to get the required information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Amount of restaurants and their types will be obtained by using Foursqare API: (https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&ne=44.418088%2C-78.362732&q=Restaurant&sw=42.742978%2C-80.554504)\n",
    "\n",
    "Location of neighborhoods in the city center will be generated algorithmically using a list of postal codes of Toronto provided by Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to find best location to open a new restaurant in Toronto mainly based on competition in different neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this I use two different data sets as mentioned above which are containing neighborhood information of Toronto such as location data (postal codes) and venues (restaurants) in each neighborhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem I use â€œK-Means Clustering Algorithm \". K-Means Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity. The results of the K-Means Clustering algorithm are: The centroids of the K clusters, which can be used to label new data Labels for the training data (each data point is assigned to a single cluster).\n",
    "In this case, K-Means Clustering will help to identify promising areas in Toronto with low number of restaurants and finally have a suggestion for the target audience where to open the new restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "__Data capturing and preprocessing__\n",
    "Starting with the analysis, I search and identify the relavant data source and capture it. In this case I use wikipedia to get data about postal codes and neighborhoods of Toronto. In the data cleaning section I remove all the redundant values. Additionally, I add longitude and latitude values to each instance and finally can provide a dataframe with the following columns: PostalCode, Borough, Neighborhood, Latitude and Longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Exploring, clustering and visualizing neighborhoods in Toronto__\n",
    "In this section, I explore the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto, using the latitude & longitude data and the Foursquare API to finally get available Top venues including restaurants in Toronto's neighborhoods. Then I cluster the neighborhoods with K-Means method and visualize these on a folium map. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Examining Clusters__\n",
    "With an assumption of 5 clusters, I use K-Cluster algorithm to come up with 5 different clusters in Toronto with similar set of venues. I explore each cluster and determine the discriminating venue categories that distinguish each cluster. Finally, I identify the clusters with maximum number restaurants and vice versa clusters which would be suitable for a new restaurant. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Results and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis shows that although there is a great number of restaurants in Toronto, there are pockets of low restaurant density fairly close to city center. There are 4 boroughs and 74 neighborhoods inside geographical coordinates of 43.653963, -79.387207.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the initial assumption of the cluster with minimum number of restaurants will have the best possibility to have a new restaurant due to the need in the area. Based on the resultant clusters it looks like Clusters 1 has a higher number of restaurants than the rest of the clusters. So these remaining clusters offer the highest potential for a new restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is entirely possible that there is a very good reason for small number of restaurants in any of those areas, reasons which would make them unsuitable for a new restaurant regardless of lack of competition in the area. Recommended zones should therefore be considered only as a starting point for more detailed analysis which could eventually result in location which has not only no nearby competition but also other factors taken into account and all other relevant conditions met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of this project was to identify areas in Toronto with low number of restaurants in order to aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new restaurant. By calculating restaurant density distribution from Foursquare data we have first identified general boroughs that justify further analysis, and then generated extensive collection of locations which satisfy some basic requirements regarding existing nearby restaurants. Clustering of those locations was then performed in order to create major zones of interest (containing greatest number of potential locations) and addresses of those zone centers were created to be used as starting points for final exploration by stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final decission on optimal restaurant location will be made by stakeholders based on specific characteristics of neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone, taking into consideration additional factors like attractiveness of each location, levels of noise such as proximity to major roads, real estate availability, prices, social and economic dynamics of every neighborhood and so on.
