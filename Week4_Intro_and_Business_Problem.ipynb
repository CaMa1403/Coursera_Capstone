    "Exploring the City of Toronto for opening new restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I will explore Toronto city's data. Imagining someone wants to open a new restaurant there, I will try to find the best fitting location in town focussing on central areas that are not already covered with many restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Business Problem and Target Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of 2,731,571 in 2016. Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA. Toronto is the fastest growing city in North America and is the anchor of an urban agglomeration, known as the Golden Horseshoe in Southern Ontario, located on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having such vast population and big geographical area, there also exists big competition between businesses. Therefore it became very challenging for new businesses to decide which area they should start their business to get higher revenue with lowest possible competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Target Audience for this project is a new business who wants to open a restaurant in Toronto. The main idea of this project is to suggest the best locality for the new restaurant in order to maximize profits in Toronto."
